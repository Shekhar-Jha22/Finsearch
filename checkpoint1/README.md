INTRO TO RL
AND DL

Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent
learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to
maximize cumulative rewards. It involves trial-and-error interactions and
learning from the outcomes of actions to improve future performance.
Deep Learning:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses
neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model
complex patterns in large datasets. It is particularly effective in tasks
such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing,
and autonomous driving.
