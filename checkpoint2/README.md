# INTRO TO SOME USEFUL ALGORITHMS

There are various RL and DL algorithms such as:
Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Policy
Gradient Methods, Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C), Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG), Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient
(TD3), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).
