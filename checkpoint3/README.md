#APPLICATION IN A PROBLEM

We are trying to solve the classic Inverted Pendulum control problem.
In this setting, we can take only two actions: swing left or swing right.
The classic inverted pendulum problem aims to stabilize an upright
pendulum (inverted position) by controlling its base in such a way
that it remains balanced. Specifically, the question being addressed is
how to control the movement of the base of the pendulum (often a
cart) so that the pendulum stays upright against the force of gravity
and any disturbances.
The code given involves a lot of python and ML concepts,
ChatGPT is your best friend if you need to understand what
is going on in the code.
