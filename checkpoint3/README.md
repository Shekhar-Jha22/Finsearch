# Application in a Problem

We are trying to solve the classic Inverted Pendulum control problem.  
In this setting, we can take only two actions: swing left or swing right.  
The classic inverted pendulum problem aims to stabilize an upright pendulum (inverted position) by controlling its base in such a way that it remains balanced.  

Specifically, the question being addressed is how to control the movement of the base of the pendulum (often a cart) so that the pendulum stays upright against the force of gravity and any disturbances.  

The code given involves a lot of Python and ML concepts â€” ChatGPT is your best friend if you need to understand what is going on in the code.
